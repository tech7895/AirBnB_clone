This repository contains the AirBnB Clone (the console)
------------------------------------------------------
Project Description:

This project is the initial stage of a team project to build a clone of the AirBnB website.
This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data.
Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage.
Implementing a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

Description of the command interpreter
-------------------------------------
The interface of the application is similar to that of the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands
that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website clone.
